# FPL-Dashboard

This is the code for the dashboard that looks at the Fantasy Premier League data for the 2020-21 Season. All the data here will explore the players who have played at least one minute of game time.

Note: The dashboard does not dynamically update during gameweeks, only at the end of each gameweek. 

The original data source comes from:
