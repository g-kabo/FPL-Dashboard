# FPL-Dashboard

This is the code for the dashboard that looks at the Fantasy Premier League data for the 2020-21 Season. All the data here will explore the players who have played at least one minute of game time.

**Link to dashboard:** https://rpubs.com/g_kabo/FPL_Dashboard

Note: The dashboard does not dynamically update, meaning old dashboards will not update with new infomation, all a user needs to do is to revisit the link.

The original data source comes from: https://github.com/vaastav/Fantasy-Premier-League
